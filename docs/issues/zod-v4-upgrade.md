# Zod v4 Upgrade PACT Workflow

## Project Overview
Upgrading tinman-chat from Zod v3 to Zod v4, ensuring idiomatic usage of new API features while maintaining type safety and compatibility with existing schema validation patterns.

## PACT Framework Progress

### Phase 0: Knowledge Loading âœ…
- [x] Read project structure and architecture (`docs/context/project-structure.md`)
- [x] Review coding standards (`docs/context/coding-standards.md`)
- [x] Understand deployment requirements (`docs/context/deployment.md`)
- [x] Note current Zod usage: "Comprehensive TypeScript coverage with Zod schema validation at all API boundaries"

### Phase 1: PREPARE ðŸ”„
**Objective**: Research Zod v4 API changes and document migration requirements

**Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive documentation of Zod v4 breaking changes
- Analysis of current Zod usage patterns in tinman-chat
- Migration strategy document in `docs/specs/zod-v4-migration.md`

**Success Criteria**:
- Complete understanding of API changes
- Inventory of all current Zod usage locations
- Clear migration path identified

### Phase 2: ARCHITECT ðŸ”„
**Objective**: Design migration strategy based on project patterns

**Deliverables**:
- Architectural design for new Zod v4 patterns
- Updated coding standards for Zod usage
- Migration sequence plan

**Dependencies**: Phase 1 completion

### Phase 3: CODE ðŸ”„
**Objective**: Implement Zod v4 upgrade across entire codebase

**Deliverables**:
- Updated package.json with Zod v4
- All schema files migrated to new API
- API routes updated with new validation patterns
- Database schema validation updated

**Dependencies**: Phase 2 completion

### Phase 4: TEST ðŸ”„
**Objective**: Comprehensive testing of upgraded schemas

**Deliverables**:
- All existing tests passing
- New test cases for Zod v4 features
- Validation of type safety improvements

**Dependencies**: Phase 3 completion

## Current Status
- **Active Phase**: Prepare (Phase 1)
- **Assigned Specialist**: pact-preparer
- **Next Phase**: Architect (pact-architect)

## Key Project Context

### Current Zod Usage (from project-structure.md)
- **Version**: Zod 3.25.68 (current)
- **Usage**: Runtime type validation and schema validation
- **Key Principle**: "Type Safety First: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage with Zod schema validation at all API boundaries"

### Critical Files to Review
- `lib/db/schema.ts` - Database schema definitions
- `app/(chat)/api/*/schema.ts` - API request/response schemas  
- All API route validation patterns
- Error handling with Zod validation

### Architecture Requirements
- Maintain streaming-first architecture compatibility
- Preserve type-safe patterns with Drizzle ORM
- Ensure NextAuth.js v5 compatibility
- Support message parts validation system

## Quality Gates
- **Prepare**: Clear documentation of API changes and migration strategy
- **Architect**: Design aligns with tinman-chat's type-safety principles
- **Code**: All existing functionality preserved with new API
- **Test**: Full test suite passes with improved type safety

## Next Session Goals
1. Complete PREPARE phase with comprehensive Zod v4 research
2. Begin ARCHITECT phase with migration strategy design
3. Identify any potential breaking changes requiring special attention
